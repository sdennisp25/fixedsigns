### fixedsigns
An Astrology Compatibility App

### Trilogy Boot-Camp Project 1

### Our Application:
Our objective was to build an astrology compatibility app that would provide potential matches based on sun signs. Once the user creates a profile, it is displayed on the page along with their sun sign description and the top three most compatible signs. If the user clicks on a match sign, any users with that sign are displayed in a table. The user then has the option to contact each match by email or to remove the match from the list if they are not interested. 

### Technologies Used:
HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Firebase, SoundAPI, & Parsley.js

### Built Using:
Visual Code

### Authors:
Cat McMillen, Carolyn Michael, Sipha Phaophongsava,& Chris Self
